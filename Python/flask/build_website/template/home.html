                <p class="small-text">
                    I always wanted to build a personal website where I will not just talk about work and projects I did before but  instead uses it as a long-term platform. 
                    I really hope this website where I could use it to enjoy creativity, learn new things, store memories,
                    share, write, be organized and keep myself motivated. It would be somewhere I could always come back and 
                    look back what happened in life and feel appreciated. Finally I made it happen while taking classes related to frontend. 
                    It also makes the studying more fun and productive.
